# Dynamic-Behavior-Intervention-Model
The repository contains MATLAB code for Dynamic Behavioral Intervention Model, which is a part of the paper "Evaluating the dynamic psychological and behavioral changes of water-saving in public buildings under effective interventions" provided by Prof. Wenyan Wu.

Fu, Yang, and Wenyan Wu. "Predicting household water use behaviour for improved hygiene practices in internet of things environment via dynamic behaviour intervention model." IET Networks 5.5 (2016): 143-151.

In this paper, we explored the development of related concepts for analyzing dynamic water demand:

(1) The concept of the theory of planned behavior (TPB):

Ajzen, Icek. "The theory of planned behavior." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 50.2 (1991): 179-211.

(2) The concept of dynamic behavior intervention model (DBIM) and its original aim for inventory analysis:

Navarro-Barrientos, J-Emeterio, Daniel E. Rivera, and Linda M. Collins. "A dynamical model for describing behavioural interventions for weight loss and body composition change." Mathematical and computer modelling of dynamical systems 17.2 (2011): 183-203.

Schwartz, Jay D., Wenlin Wang, and Daniel E. Rivera. "Simulation-based optimization of process control policies for inventory management in supply chains." Automatica 42.8 (2006): 1311-1320.

For the qualification of TPB:

(1) Extensive questionnaires are needed with a good design of questions:

Spinks, Anneliese, et al. Water demand management study: Baseline survey of household water use (Part A). Brisbane, Australia: Urban Water Security Research Alliance, 2011.
Fielding, Kelly, et al. Water demand management study: Baseline survey of household water use (Part B). Urban Water Security Research Alliance, 2012.

(2) Verifying the validity and reliability is necessary:

Fielding, Kelly S., Rachel McDonald, and Winnifred R. Louis. "Theory of planned behaviour, identity and intentions to engage in environmental activism." Journal of environmental psychology 28.4 (2008): 318-326.

(3) Then, TPB can be calculated by the structural equation model (SEM):

Byrne, B. M. (2013). Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming. Routledge.

For the qualification of DBIM:

(1) Conducting field questionnaires surveys is necessary to obtain the initial values or variables.

(2) Obtain dynamic data.

(3) Optimization methods can be applied to compare simulated values with actual data.
